### Part 1 - Soften primary ingredients

#### Ingredients

1 medium-ish red pepper  
8-10 ounces of fresh pineapple chunks  
2 cups of chicken broth

Pour the chicken broth into the pan first,
Dice the red pepper and the pineapple chunks and throw them also into the pan.
(It's really important to use fresh pineapple, not canned pineapple;
the flavor is dramatically different and the pieces are more sinewy.)
Heat on medium for at least 15 minutes.

### Part 2 - Add curry

#### Ingredients

1/2 of 4 ounce can yellow curry paste  
1 can (14 ounces) of coconut milk  

Open can, and mix in the curry paste.
Then throw in coconut milk.

Heat for another ten minutes or so.

### Part 3a - Poach chicken

#### Ingredients

1/2 pound of chicken breast  

Dice chicken and throw into pan.
Heat dish for another 15 minutes or so or until chicken has sufficiently whitened.

### Part 3b - Cook rice

#### Ingredients

1 1/2 cup of rice  

Cook rice in parallel.

When everything is all ready, serve curry dish over rice;
it should be delish!
