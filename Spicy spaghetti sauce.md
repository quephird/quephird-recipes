#### Ingredients

4 large tomatoes  
1 red bell pepper  
1 green bell pepper  
1/3 white onion  
16 fl. oz. chicken or vegetable stock  
2 long green chile peppers  
1 pound of spicy Italian sausage  
1 tablespoon of salt, YMMV  
1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes, YMMV  

Put a pan on medium heat and cover bottom with a thin film of EVOO.
Dice all of the sausage and throw into pan.
Cook the sausage until browned.
Remove the sausage and set aside in a large bowl or a plate.
In another deep pan, pour in the chicken or vegetable stock.
Dice the tomatoes, onion, all three kinds of peppers and throw them into it.
Turn the heat up to somewhere between medium and high.
(If you like, in the same pan used to cook the sausage, add some water and stir to get the rest of the bits of sausage and oils, and also add to the main batch.)
Keeping adding as much water as necessary to keep the sauce from drying out.
Cook for somewhere between 15 and 30 minutes.
Throw in the sausage and stir into the sauce so it isn't clumped together.
Cook for another thirty minutes or so.
Depending on the sweetness of the tomatoes and your taste you should stir in around a tablespoon of salt.
Serve over whatever pasta you desire.
