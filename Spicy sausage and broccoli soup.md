This recipe was adapted from [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Williams-Sonoma-Complete-Pasta-Cookbook-Collection/dp/073702030X).

### 1. Prepare sausage

#### Ingredients

1 pound of spicy sausage  
2 tablespoons of EVOO  

Put EVOO on pan, turn heat to medium/high.
Poke holes in sides of sausages with fork, place them in the pan, and cook them until they turn brown.

### 2. Prepare broth

#### Ingredients

48 fluid ounces of chicken stock  
1 jalapeño pepper, diced  

Use the same pan as above and add stock and diced jalapeño.
(I did this to use the juices from the sausages in the broth as well.)
Bring to boil.

### 3. Develop broth

#### Ingredients

1 pound of broccoli  

Dice broccoli and throw in broth.
After about a half hour, the broccoli should be tender and its flavor infused into the broth.
Turn down heat to low.
(Add water as needed.)

### 4. Cook pasta

1 pound campanelle  

I used this pasta instead of orecchiette because I wanted the pasta to soak in more of the soup.
Cook until al dente and drain.
Place however much pasta you desire in a large bowl and ladle soup accordingly.
YUM.
