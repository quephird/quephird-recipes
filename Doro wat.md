### Part 1 - Saut√©e onions

#### Ingredients

1/2 large white onion  
2 tablespoons EVOO  
2 tablespoons butter  
2 big cloves garlic  
1 tablespoon of minced ginger (which equates to about an inch of root)  

Heat onions et. al medium for about twenty minutes. Keep putting just a tiny amount of chicken broth or water in to prevent browning or burning.

4 tablespoons berbere spice

Dice the tomato and throw it and the rest of the ingredients into the pan and heat for another ten minutes or so.

### Part 3 - Add chicken

#### Ingredients

1 chicken breast

Dice into small cubes and throw into sauce and let whiten.

### Part 4 - Prepare rice

#### Ingredients

1 1/2 cups of white rice

Make rice; I like to throw in a tablespoon of two into the rice to insure that it's tasty and doesn't stick to the ricemaker. :S

### Part 5 - Serve and enjoy!

Put rice on dish and ladle as much of the sauce and chicken as desired.
