### Part 2 - Sautée onions and tomatoes

2 to 4 tablespoons of butter (depending on your preference)  
3 tablespoons lemon juice  
1/2 cup white wine  
1 tablespoon black pepper

### Part 3 - Cook scallops

#### Ingredients

1/2 to 1 pound of large scallops (depending on your appetite and how many you're serving)  

Place scallops in sautée on one side, distributing them evenly in the pan.
Heat on medium for no more than five minutes.
After five minutes, flip them all over onto the other side.
They should be whitened on the side that was face down before.
Lather sautée onto them so they are submerged and cook for another five minutes.
