### Step 1 - Prepare broth

#### Ingredients

4 cups chicken broth  
1/3 onion diced  
4 tablespoons lime juice  
5 tablespoons fish sauce  
2 tablespoons sugar  
2 lemongrass stalks  
1 tablespoon of ginger, minced  
1 tablespoon salt  

Cut the lemongrass stalks in half.
Then take the blunt end of the knife and bruise the entire length of all the pieces.
Pour the broth in a pan on high, and add all the ingredients.
Bring to a boil, and let it do so for five minutes.
Turn heat down to medium and let sit for 15 minutes.

### Step 2 - Develop soup

#### Ingredients

4 tablespoons chili paste  
1/2 pound of chicken diced  
1 jalape√±o pepper diced  
4 ounces gourmet blend of mushrooms (crimini, shiitake, oyster)  
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes  
2 plum tomatoes, diced  

You may or may now want to remove all lemon grass pieces from soup now.
Leaving them until the end will yield a slightly more citrusy taste.
Add all ingredients to soup and let heat for an additional 30 minutes.
Serve in a bowl.
You may want to even serve over pasta or udon.
