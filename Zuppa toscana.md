#### Ingredients

3 medium or large red potatoes  
1 pound spicy Italian sausage  
1/2 pound bacon
1/3 medium white onion  
2-4 cloves of garlic  
5 ounces of spinach leaves  
1 cup chicken broth  
2-5 tablespoons red pepper flakes  
1/2 cup heavy cream or half-and-half  

#### Procedure

Dice the potatoes into tiny cubes.
Fill a pot with enough water to fully submerge all the potatoes and set to boil.
Throw in the potatoes and boil them for about 20-30 minutes or until soft.
In parallel, heat another pan on somewhere between medium and high.
Cut the sausage into bite-sized pieces and cook until brown and then set it aside.
Then cook the bacon until crispy and dice it too.
Throw all of the meat into the pot with the potatoes.
Dice the onion and garlic and also add it all to the pot.
Add red pepper flakes to make as spicy as desired.
Turn the heat down to low and let sit for about another 30 minutes.
Add the heavy cream/half-and-half afterwards and stir.
Serve in a bowl.
