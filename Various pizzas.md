#### Making pizza dough

I make pizza dough from scratch using a tiny variation of Bobby Flay's recipe, [here](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/member/views/pizza-dough-bobby-flay-5b711de44e722a4f20884ace)

3 1/2 to 4 cups flour  
1 envelope instant dry yeast  
1 tablespoon salt  
1 teaspoon sugar  
2 tablespoons olive oil  
1 1/2 cups hot water  

I just throw everything into a large salad bowl and stir the mixture, gradually adding the hot water and continuing to stir until the dough turns into a wet ball. Then I let it sit somewhere for about an hour. After that I scoop the dough out of the bowl and I repeatedly add flour and knead the dough until it turns into almost like Play-doh. Then I split the ball into two, where each one should be enough for a 14" pizza. Sometimes I put them both away for a day, since dough seems to work better after "aging" a bit, but using one right away is fine.
