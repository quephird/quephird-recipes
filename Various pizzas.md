#### Making pizza dough

I make pizza dough from scratch using a tiny variation of Bobby Flay's recipe, [here](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/member/views/pizza-dough-bobby-flay-5b711de44e722a4f20884ace)

3 1/2 to 4 cups flour  
1 envelope instant dry yeast  
1 tablespoon salt  
1 teaspoon sugar  
2 tablespoons olive oil  
1 1/2 cups hot water  

I just throw everything into a large salad bowl and stir the mixture, gradually adding the hot water and continuing to stir until the dough turns into a wet ball. Then I let it sit somewhere for about an hour. After that I scoop the dough out of the bowl and I repeatedly add flour and knead the dough until it turns into almost like Play-doh. Then I split the ball into two, where each one should be enough for a 14" pizza. Sometimes I put them both away for a day, since dough seems to work better after "aging" a bit, but using one right away is fine.

#### Homemade pizza sauce

1 22 ounce can of Italian plum tomatoes  
1/2 large onion, diced
2-4 cloves garlic, minced  
4 tablespoons cilantro  
4 tablespoons oregano  
4 tablespoons basil, diced  
2-4 tablespoons red pepper flakes  

##### TODO: Add directions for homemade pizza sauce.


#### SHOW ME THE PIZZAS

1 pound applewood smoked bacon  
1/2 pound kielbasa  
2 large onions  
2 tablespoons butter  
apple cider  
1/2 pound smoked Gouda cheese  
1 pound mozzarella cheese  
2 jalapeño peppers  
1 Granny apple  
red pepper flakes  

Cook the bacon until crispy, and dice both it and the kielbasa and set aside. Dice the onions and put into a pan with 2 tablespoons of butter and about 1/2 apple cider. After it is all caramelized, set aside. Dice the jalapeños and Granny apple and set aside. Make a bedding of shredded mozzarella and Gouda cheeses on the pizza dough. Spread the bacon and kielbasa over the pizza, then the onions and finally the jalapeños. _Be sure not to put the apple on before putting the pizza in the oven as it will lose its texture and flavor._ Put in the oven for about ten to fifteen minutes. After baking, spread the diced apple over the pizza, and add red pepper flakes for heat if you like.
